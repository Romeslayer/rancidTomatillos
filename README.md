 Rancid tomatillos is a multipage web application that users can use to find their favorite media title and get the average rating.

## Learning Goals
  Our learning goals were to:
   - create a React application 
   - Deploy a React app to GitHub pages
   - End-to-end testing with Cypress
   - Refactor with Router to create a multipage web application

## How to Run
  This app is deployed on GitHub pages and can be found [here](https://romeslayer.github.io/rancidTomatillos/)

## App Progression

We started building the app with a wireframe and component structure. Using those to start off with we had created a React App that was single paged, but fully functional. Then we introduced a new technology Router. Router allowed us to make our React application respond how a typical webpage would.
